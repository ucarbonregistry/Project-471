Carbon Credit Generation Project by NSL Sugars Ltd. at Pawarwadi, Maharashtra, India

NSL Sugars Limited (NSL), is one of the most efficient sugar companies in south India and a sugar
arm of ‘NSL’ group. NSL Group entered the ‘sugar’ business being related to agro- commercial crop
business. NSL Group has took over this plant during the year 2011 under the unit names “NSL Sugars
Ltd Unit III, Jay Mahesh” and increased its production capacity from 4500 MT/day to 7000 MT/day.
Thus the Project is owned by M/s NSL Sugars Ltd Unit III, Jay Mahesh and hereby to be called as
Project Proponent.

NSL Sugars plant has been working with the state of art equipment(s) for sugar to achieve 7000
MT/day crushing and 30 MW bagasse based co-gen power plant since commissioning in 07/01/2013.
The current project activity included under this UCR document is located in Pawarwadi Village,
Majalgaon Taluka in the district of Beed in Maharashtra state.

The main scope of carbon credits are as follows:

Scope 1: Generation of carbon credits due to an existing 30 MW bagasse-based co-generation
unit at Pawarwadi sugar mill.

Scope 2: Generation of carbon credits due to production and applicability of bioethanol
produced in the unit which is supplied to OMCs for blending with petrol or equivalent
services.

Both these scopes are well recognized activity under GHG mechanisms due to the reduction of carbon
emissions as compared to their respective baseline scenarios viz. displacement of grid electricity with
the export power produced & supplied from the co-generation unit and displacement of petrol with a
share of blending of bioethanol supplied by NSL.

The Co-generation Unit:
The purpose of the project activity is to utilize available mill generated bagasse effectively for
generation of steam and electricity for both in-house consumption and to export surplus electricity to
the power grid. The project meets the captive steam and power requirement of sugar unit, cogeneration (Cogen) plant auxiliaries and power requirement of the facilities. The balance power is exported to Indian Grid (MSEDCL).

As per design specification, the unit has an existing co-generation unit with installed capacity of 30
MW turbine, out of which 2% of gross electricity generated is assumed to be imported electricity.
During the off season the plant generates 27.25 MW of power with 3.5 MW of captive consumption
load and during the season the plant generates 17.5 MW of power with 14 MW of captive
consumption load. 

PLF for the plant during off season is 90.83% and during the season it is 58.33%
and the plant is operational since commissioning on 07/01/2013.

The major equipment of the project activity comprises 135 Tons Per Hour (TPH) capacity steam
generator with the outlet steam parameters of 110 atm and 540oC, 30 MW Siemens make back
pressure type.

Plant operates for 240 days per annum approximately, which includes 180 days of crushing season,
and 60 days of off-season. The plant is designed with all other auxiliary plant systems like bagasse /
biomass handling system with storage and processing arrangements, ash handling system, water
treatment plant, cooling water system and cooling tower, De-Mineralized (DM) water plant,
compressed air system and balance of plant including high pressure piping etc. for its successful
operation. The provision of extraction cum condensing machine allows the possibility of operating
the plant during the off-season with the saved bagasse and procured surplus biomass residues.

The Bioethanol Unit:
The purpose of bioethanol plant is to produce ethanol for blending with regular fuel as substitute.
Bioethanol fuel is mainly produced by the sugar fermentation process, although it can also be
manufactured by the chemical process of reacting ethylene with steam. Ethanol can be produced from
biomass by the hydrolysis and sugar fermentation processes. Biomass wastes contain a complex
mixture of carbohydrate polymers from the plant cell walls known as cellulose, hemi cellulose and
lignin. In order to produce sugars from the biomass, the biomass is pre-treated with acids or enzymes
in order to reduce the size of the feedstock and to open up the plant structure. Thus, bioethanol from
sugar plan is the output of series process that goes through Fermentation, Distillation and Molecular
Sieve Dehydration (MSDH) process.

The project activity was commissioned in May 2021 and bioethanol is being produced for producing
blended biofuel by OMCs to whom NSL has supply contracts. This blended biofuel is finally used as
fuel in existing stationary installations (e.g. diesel generators) and/or in vehicles within India. The
project activity is hence a renewable energy project activity that displaces more-GHG-intensive fossil
fuel for combustion in vehicles and stationary installations.

The key features of the bioethanol project scope are as follows:
Existing installed capacity : 250 KLPD

Purpose : To supply for biofuel blending by Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs)

Blending types : B10 and B20.

The energy values : 44.22 MJ/kg with a blend of 10% (E10)

The targeted blending : Current-12-13%, however, as per central government order to be
achieved 25% blending by year of 2025.

NSL Sugars Limited (NSL), project activity has implemented the combination of two scopes (power
& bioethanol) which are well recognized activities under GHG mechanisms due to the reduction of
carbon emissions as compared to the baseline scenarios viz. displacement of grid electricity with the
export power produced & supplied from the co-generation unit.
Thus, the project activity scopes help to contribute to emission reductions as well as SDG targets
creating a sustainable pathway.
